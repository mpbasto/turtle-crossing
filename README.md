### ⚠️ Attention! Turtle Crossing 🐢

Turtle-Crossing is a game created with Python's Turtle module. The goal is to ensure that our turtle (for those asking, his name is Steve) crosses the busy roads of Cumbria safely. Yes, there are turtles in Cumbria! (no, there isn't...)

* To help Steve cross the road, just press the 'up' arrow on your keyboard.
* To start a new game press the spacebar.
